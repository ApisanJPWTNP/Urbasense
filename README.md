# Urbasense

"Urban residents are facing increasing challenges to their personal rest, mental health, and productivity due to noise pollution and the fast-paced nature of city living."

Background
Urban residents often face challenges arising from noise pollution, stress, and a fast-paced lifestyle. These factors can negatively impact personal rest, mental health, and productivity. UrbaSense was created as a solution to these urban issues, leveraging IoT technology to improve the quality of life by enhancing the environment through sensory adjustments.

Market Research
Urban Living & Mental Health
21% more likely to experience anxiety disorders.
39% more likely to develop mood disorders.
Environmental stress can elevate the risk of developing psychiatric conditions, such as:
Anxiety
Depression
Bipolar Disorder
Urban Living & Sleep Quality
6% of individuals living in highly lit urban areas sleep less than 6 hours per night.
29% report dissatisfaction with their sleep quality.
Exposure to noise is a major factor contributing to poor sleep quality in urban environments.
Impact of Urban Living on Productivity & Development
Increased noise exposure in urban areas is linked to:
Poorer educational outcomes for children (e.g., reading and math skills).
Reduced focus and productivity in adults due to high-stress environments.
Customer Insights
Target Audience: Urban residents, students, and working professionals.
Common Issues:
Difficulty focusing due to noise and stress.
Preference for peace and quiet while working or studying.
Reliance on noise-canceling headphones to mitigate distractions.
Sensitivity to light and its impact on productivity.
Desire for natural light and external factors that help regulate circadian rhythm for optimal functioning.
Objectives
Reduce environmental disturbances and improve rest quality.
Automate environmental settings using AI and machine learning to tailor the atmosphere for individual needs.

Solution Overview
UrbaSense is an IoT-based software solution that integrates with home appliances to help users control their environment. The software uses AI and machine learning to optimize light, sound, and other environmental factors, improving the user’s atmosphere. By leveraging Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) technology and IoT integration, UrbaSense aims to create a highly customized, noise-free, and restful environment for its users.

Core Features:
Integration with IoT devices to control light, sound, temperature, and air quality.
AI-powered automation based on user preferences and environmental factors.
Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) for minimizing disruptions.
